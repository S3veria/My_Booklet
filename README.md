DISCLAIMER: All of the  icons used in this app where taken from https://www.flaticon.com/
I do not take any ownership for the making of the icons used and highly suggest you visit their webpage, they really do have great images available for free

The email feature is not usable out of the gate, you will need to enter your email and password in the required fields (marked with comments in the .py file).
For the email feature to work with your email adress, you need to enable less secure app access, which you can do here for gmail acocunts: https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps
Since I did not want to risk having such little security in my personal gmail, I created an alternate account to use with the program, which I suggest you do as well.

This is my first real python project, I am very excited to publish it and for all of you to enjoy.
I developed this app to solve an actual problem I was having and I am more than glad I did, it ended up being a bit of a challenge, making it a joy to make.
Greeting and enjoy My_Booklet
